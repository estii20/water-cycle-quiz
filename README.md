# Water Cycle Quiz

A quiz to test the key concepts of the water cycle for primary school children, KS2 aged between 7 and 11 years. A fun way to put into practice what the children have learnt in class. An online quiz format is more interactive for children and suits visual learners in particular. Ideal for students and teachers who learn and teach remotely.

This quiz asks questions about the water cycle namely; evaporation, condensation, precipitation and ground runoff.
The questions will test the knowledge of how Water is recycled in a process called the water cycle. 
Evaporation - water in the sea rises as vapour into the sky. 
Condensation - droplets form and become clouds. 
Rain (precipitation) falls onto the ground from clouds. 
Water runs off the land until it reaches a river. 
Water moves  along the river and into the sea.
The process begins again.

The Chrome extension tool [eyedropper tool Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/eye-dropper/hmdcmlfkchdmnmnmheododdhjedfccka?hl=pt) was used to pick out the main three colors for the background.
The green color of `#79caff`, the beige color of `#e4e170` and the blue color of `#1a913d`. 
The buttons have a background color of `#f5f5f5` a whitesmoke color to provide a contrast to the text without being as harsh on the eyes as white.
The hover color used for the buttons is also `#e4e170`, to give a cohesive visual. 

The quiz area background uses the background image of hills and sky to complement the subject of the water cycle.
